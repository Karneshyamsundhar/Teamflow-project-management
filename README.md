# TeamFlow — Enterprise-Grade Project & Incident Management Workspace

TeamFlow is a high-performance, responsive full-stack SaaS application engineered for modern engineering departments and cross-functional task planning. Adopting premium aesthetic cues from leading modern systems (such as Linear, Vercel, and Stripe), TeamFlow unifies agile board workspaces, incident response dispatchers, real-time analytics reports, secure role-based access control, and advanced user profiles under one cohesive environment.

---
## 📌 Overview
TeamFlow is a full-stack project and incident management system designed to support team collaboration, task tracking, and incident handling. The system is built using a modular monolithic architecture for simplicity, maintainability, and scalability.


## 🚀 Key Features

### 👤 Identity & Gateways
*   **Unified Enterprise Sign In / Sign Up**: Redesigned credential gates featuring beautiful glassmorphic visual layout, keyboard access, custom form validations, and password visibility controllers.
*   **Remember Me sessioning**: Preserves remembered work email securely across sessions.
*   **Forgot / Reset Password workflow**: Complete tokenized validation flow. Sends dynamic rich HTML reset forms via Nodemailer with local sandbox short-cuts to streamline browser testing.
*   **Password Strength Meter**: Dynamic regex-based analyzer grading password entropy with interactive progress bars.

### 🛡️ Role-Based Security (RBAC)
*   **Administrator (ID: 1)**: System-wide master controller. Oversees schema registers, establishes teams, and manages all workspace configurations.
*   **Project Manager (ID: 2)**: Core workflow planner. Schedules boards, defines tasks, assigns items to engineers, and drives incident resolution.
*   **Developer (ID: 3)**: Active engineer. Manipulates personal kanban boards, advances tasks from To-Do to Completed, and files risk incident alerts.

### 📋 Agile Kanban Board & Tasks
*   **Dual View Modes**: Switch between high-fidelity visual cards on a Kanban board or modular lists with column headers.
*   **Task State Tracking**: Fast column updates covering To-Do, In Progress, Review, and Completed.
*   **Advanced Task Attributes**: Priority color-coding, due-date visual indicators, task details view, and user avatars.

### 🚨 Incident Response Mitigation
*   **Severity Categorization**: High-contrast labels indicating risk (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
*   **Chronological Activity Streams**: Live feed summarizing user mutations and task state changes.

### 📊 Real-Time Workspaces & Reports
*   **Interactive Charts**: Data visualization using custom `Recharts` graphs showing task completion breakdown, priority volume, and incident risk allocation.
*   **Custom Saved Queries**: Save and filter project lists for persistent reporting sheets.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend Architecture
*   **React (v19)**: Component-based UI rendering.
*   **TypeScript**: Type-safety throughout.
*   **Vite**: Rapid Hot-Module compilation.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: High-utility spacing, grid systems, and adaptive responsive prefixes.
*   **Framer Motion**: Fluid entry transitions, layout morphing, and interactive micro-animations.
*   **Lucide React**: Clean vector icon library.

### Backend Engine
*   **Node.js & Express**: Extensible REST API.
*   **Prisma ORM**: Modern database mapping, typed client queries, and pre-seeded schemas.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Stateless authorization keys.
*   **Bcrypt**: Safe password salt hashing.
*   **Nodemailer**: Secure transactional mail dispatcher.

## 🧩 Architecture

The application follows a *Modular Monolithic Architecture*, where all components exist in a single codebase but are logically divided into independent modules.

### 🔹 Layers of the System

1. *Frontend Layer*
   - Built using React and TypeScript
   - Handles user interface and user interactions
   - Communicates with backend via REST APIs

2. *Backend Layer (API)*
   - Built using Node.js and Express
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Contains controllers for business logic:
     - Authentication
     - Projects
     - Tasks
     - Incidents

3. *ORM Layer*
   - Prisma ORM is used for database interaction
   - Provides type-safe queries
   - Simplifies database operations

4. *Database Layer*
   - MySQL database for persistent storage
   - Stores users, roles, projects, tasks, and incidents

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. User interacts with the frontend (React)
2. Frontend sends API request to backend (Express)
3. Backend processes request via controllers
4. Prisma interacts with MySQL database
5. Response is sent back to frontend

Flow:
Client → API → Controller → Prisma → Database → Response

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) used for authentication
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implemented
- Protected routes require valid tokens

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Monolithic Architecture
- Chosen for simplicity and easier deployment
- Avoids complexity of microservices
- Suitable for medium-scale applications

### 2. Use of Prisma ORM
- Provides type safety and cleaner queries
- Reduces risk of SQL errors
- Simplifies migrations and schema management

### 3. REST API Design
- Simple and widely used architecture
- Easy integration between frontend and backend
- Stateless communication using HTTP methods

### 4. JWT Authentication
- Enables stateless authentication
- Scalable and secure
- Eliminates need for server-side sessions

### 5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Ensures proper authorization
- Different access levels for Admin, Manager, Developer
- Improves system security

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No real-time updates (WebSockets not implemented)
- Basic UI optimizations
- Monolithic structure may limit scalability at very large scale

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Implement real-time features using WebSockets
- Improve UI/UX design
- Add microservices architecture for scalability
- Introduce caching for performance optimization

## 📦 Local Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   MySQL Server running locally or in a container

### Steps
1.  **Clone the Repository** and navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/teamflow.git
    cd teamflow
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run Database Migrations & Seeds**:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    npx prisma db seed
    ```
4.  **Start Development Servers**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will launch on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 🐳 Production Deployment Guide

To bundle and deploy TeamFlow inside container clusters (such as Cloud Run or AWS ECS):

1.  **Compile production files**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This triggers a production build. Esbuild bundles the backend code into `dist/server.cjs` and Vite compiles static SPA assets into `dist/`.
2.  **Launch Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    The Express wrapper serves static compiled assets and API endpoints simultaneously from port `3000`.
